üíâ Diabetes Prediction: Logistic Regression Capstone Project
Project Overview
This project implements a complete Machine Learning pipeline using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to build and evaluate a Logistic Regression model. The goal is to classify whether a female patient of Pima Indian heritage is likely to test positive for diabetes (1) or negative (0) based on diagnostic measurements.

This repository serves as the final submission for the Machine Learning Foundations course capstone project, demonstrating proficiency in data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

üìå Project Objectives
The project successfully completes the following core ML steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial data inspection and identification of data quality issues (specifically, zero values representing missing data).

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values via Imputation (replacing zeros with the median), defining features (X) and target (y).

Model Preparation: Performing Train-Test Split (70%/30%) and Feature Scaling (StandardScaler).

Model Training: Implementing and training a Logistic Regression classification model.

Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using key classification metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and the Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score).

üíæ Dataset
The project uses the diabetes.csv file, which is a version of the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.
